# Registration-Form
Here I have created a basic registration form using only HTML. It includes different features as listed below.
Initially, it starts with texts boxes asking for first and last names. It also includes placeholders.
It includes radio buttons for defining gender.
It contains a dropdown list for selecting departments.
The next line contains textbox which lets you enter country code and phone number which also includes a placeholder.
It has a size adjustable textbox to enter address.
It contains checkboxes for entering the languages known.
It enables you to upload a document using a choose file button to upload your resume.
It asks for an email address with placeholders.
It has features to accept passwords.
It contains two buttons at the end of the form, one to submit and the other to clear your responses.
HTML5 is coded on Sublime Text to create this form.
